unit test:
    1. parser test:
        - expected string:
            - with operator +, -, *, /
            - with different ccy: CNY USD CFH
            - with decimal, no decimal, 0, and extreme large values
        - unexpected string, throw exception:
            - missing one of first value, operator, second value, equal symbol
            - incorrect ccy, like CN
            - incorrect value, like 10.0k
    2. calculator test:
        - expected results:
            - with operator +, -, *, /
            - with ccy converted correctly for first input ccy to output ccy
            - with ccy converted correctly for second input ccy to output ccy
            - with same ccy of input and output, no need to call proxy
        - exception case:
            - with second input value 0 and operator /
integration test:
    1. inputs and output with same ccy, 4 kinds of operation(+-*/), CNY CNY = CNY
    2. inputs with same ccy, output with another ccy, 4 kinds of operation(+-*/), USD USD = CNY
    3. one input and output with same ccy, the other input with another ccy, 4 kinds of operation(+-*/), CNY CFH = CFH / CFH CNY = CFH
    4. inputs and output with different ccy, 4 kinds of operation(+-*/), CNY CFH = USD
